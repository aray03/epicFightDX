###In 10th grade I made this project. I spent a lot of time on it and submitted it to the AP Board for our final project. I ended up getting a 3 on it, which honestly makes me sad so I am rewriting it so that I can achive what my original goal was. 
###Now that I have 3+ more years of experience, I will make this exactly how I want it to be!

##TODO
- Use Keyboard buttons as Input
- Create a better storage organizer
- UI?
- Generally make it more functional
- Squash Bugs
- Create random encounters that function correctly
- Spread it across multiple files because rn it's gross
